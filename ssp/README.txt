SLIDESHOWPRO FOR FLASH: README

-============================================================================-

Thank you for purchasing SlideShowPro for Flash.

This product is distributed in two forms: as a Macromedia/Adobe Extension and
as a compiled SWF for web developers without a supported version of Flash.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. EXTENSION
                     
If you own Flash you should install the extension version. Simply open the 
"Extension" folder included alongside this document, and double-click on the 
MXP file inside. The extension will install and make the SlideShowPro for Flash
component available to you in Flash. For more information on how to use the 
component, and how to create slideshow content, refer to either the "Quick 
Start" PDF or the full "User Guide" PDF included in the "Docs" folder.

2. STANDALONE

This directory contains a published version of SlideShowPro for Flash with a
XML file that may be modified to control the appearance, behavior, dimensions, 
and data that SlideShowPro for Flash loads. These edits are made through the 
"param.xml" file, which includes all properties of the component set to its 
default values. For information on the acceptable values you may assign, open 
Standalone/ActionScript/Help/properties included in this archive.

Please note that this version of the product should only be used by experienced
web developers who are able to edit XML/HTML markup, and is *not* recommended
for beginners or those who own Flash (and can use the extension).
